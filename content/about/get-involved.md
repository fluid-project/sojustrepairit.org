## Get Involved

{{< heading-rule >}}

This project is being created through iterative cycles of co-design with youth and supporting organisations. We are seeking stories from youth with learning differences and from those who work with youth with learning differences.

If you are interested in being involved, please get in touch! You can email us at <idrc@ocadu.ca> or collaborate with us on the [Fluid Project Wiki](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit).
