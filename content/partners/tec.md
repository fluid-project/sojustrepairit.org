Through educational experiences Tecnológico de Monterrey helps students become agents of change. Their social development network of students and volunteers works year-round to provide training and guidance, and promotes an entrepreneurial spirit among marginalized communities, boosting innovation through productive projects. Tecnológico de Monterrey tackles the education gap in Mexico through Prepanet, a socially responsible online platform for anyone who wishes to finish their high school studies regardless of their schedule, age, or economic status.

### SJRK work
